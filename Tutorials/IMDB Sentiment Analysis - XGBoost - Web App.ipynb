    "\n",
    "For this and most other tasks we will be doing using SageMaker, there are two methods we could use. The first is to use the low level functionality of SageMaker which requires knowing each of the objects involved in the SageMaker environment. The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the method `upload_data()` which is a member of the object representing our current SageMaker session. What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable. To see this for yourself, once you have uploaded the data files, go to the S3 console and look to see where the files have been uploaded.\n",

    "Now that we've fit our XGBoost model, it's time to see how well it performs. To do this we will use SageMakers Batch Transform functionality. Batch Transform is a convenient way to perform inference on a large dataset in a way that is not realtime. That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can perform inference on a large number of samples. An example of this in industry might be performing an end of month report. This method of inference can also be useful to us as it means that we can perform inference on our entire test set. \n",

    "To perform a Batch Transformation we need to first create a transformer objects from our trained estimator object."

In our case we are providing our model with csv data so we specify `text/csv`. Also, if the test data that we have provided is too large to process all at once then we need to specify how the data file should be split up. Since each line is a single entry in our data set we tell SageMaker that it can split the input on each line."

Remember that when we constructed and tested our model we started with a movie review, then we simplified it by removing any html formatting and punctuation, then we constructed a bag of words embedding and the resulting vector is what we sent to our model.

We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs.

In addition, we will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.\n",
